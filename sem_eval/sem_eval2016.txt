By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !####[([42], [41], 'NEG')]
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !####[([21], [23], 'NEG')]

I have never been so disgusted by both food an service .####[([8], [5], 'NEG'), ([10], [5], 'NEG')]
However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .####[([38], [52], 'NEG'), ([15, 16], [7], 'NEG')]
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .####[([24], [12], 'NEG')]

Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City####[([4], [3], 'POS')]

If you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .####[([27, 28], [25], 'POS')]
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .####[([6, 7, 8], [5], 'POS')]

Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just can ’ t say enough good things about this brasserie .####[([43], [39], 'POS')]
They are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !####[([11], [10], 'NEG')]

There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about .####[([3], [42], 'NEG')]
